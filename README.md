Privacy minded way to scan QR codes and barcodes.

---

### `V1.0.0` Roadmap:

- [ ] Reliably scan a barcode and QR code.
- [ ] Add UI for the scanning.
- [ ] Create proper API for outputting basic barcode/QR code information.
- [ ] Write unit tests for both API and package.

Feel free to reach out to me. I will try and update the package as much as I can.
